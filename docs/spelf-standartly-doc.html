      <h2>üìò Overview</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>Floatboat</strong> is a secure and modular execution environment built to support the <strong>SPELF</strong> (Secure Portable Executable Linktable Formattable) format. The primary aim of Floatboat is to deliver advanced protection mechanisms for executable files and deter unauthorized access or reverse engineering attempts.
      </p>
      <p>
        The "Floatboat" name metaphorically represents the idea of a solitary, secure vessel floating amidst an ocean of threats‚Äîmuch like how executables exist in today‚Äôs hostile cyber landscape. Traditional binary formats are often vulnerable to cracking, dumping, disassembly, and reverse engineering. While many software solutions attempt to mitigate these threats via web authentication or obfuscation, Floatboat introduces a new legal and technical layer of protection.
      </p>
      <p>
        With SPELF and Floatboat, developers gain the ability to conditionally disable the attacker's system based on memory footprints, process identifiers, or unauthorized system modifications‚Äîwithout needing full system privileges. Once a violation is detected and verified, a counter-response mechanism is triggered, halting the attack through controlled memory manipulation or process interruption.

This documentary is just official explanations. Therefore, you can find the instructions you need to use it here. "Floatboat", namely floating-boat floater-boat, this term should actually be developed more widely and standardly for the float-based data type of the software and to emphasize the security innovative open standards and to emphasize that you are as alone as a boat on the shore of the sea in this cyber world. Just like the security layer of an executables file, this layer can always be easily solved and hacked. In fact, there have been those who have tried to establish a market ecosystem on it. That's why many software have tried to prevent these methods with web-based solutions, but the problem is that standard and new solutions have been produced to prevent the protection of executables files, but despite this, hackers have tried to be successful with methods such as "cracking", "dumping", "dissambelly", but this era is over. This software  give you the rights to protect your executables file and manage it. It will be a software that will deter attackers by giving unlimited access and will add a new "condition" to the license terms, so that the executables file cannot be broken or hacked in any way. The attacker's computer will be disabled with a correct attack method against the other party who wants to hack. I know this method may remind you of companies like "cloudflare" "nintendo" "google" but with this method, a layer of protection against the non-market ecosystem will come into play and since these standards and software responsibilities are on the manufacturer, this is the only legal and logical way. isitdefine, in other words, is it you definetivitiliy, with this method, the attacker's necessary memory footprints or running pid or non-identity file internal system attacks are detected and the software is now open to access by obtaining the necessary permissions from the computer and after is it define is triggered, the function that will disable the target attacker's computer is activated. If you do not need to obtain sysroot permissions, you can detect additional memory structures that will infiltrate the system in permissionless mode or attack according to the attacker's memory footprints and disable the system in any way you want. You can understand better with the photo example below.

     Because defense is a right, not aggression. And Floatboat defines this right as a sacred order.The things I wrote as a warning do not exactly match the general purpose of the software, they are just general ideas about the development structure of the software. Using it as self-defense is prohibited and the people who use it will take responsibility in this regard.

      <h2>üì¶ SPELF Format Specification</h2>
      <p>The SPELF format consists of the following segments:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Header:</strong> Contains metadata, security checksums, and versioning info.</li>
        <li><strong>Code Segment:</strong> Holds encrypted or signed instruction sets.</li>
        <li><strong>Linktable:</strong> References to external memory or symbol addresses.</li>
        <li><strong>Resource Section:</strong> Includes embedded static data or formattable blobs.</li>
      </ul>
      <pre><code>
[ SPELF HEADER ]
[ CODE SEGMENT ]
[ LINKTABLE ]
[ RESOURCES ]
      </code></pre>

    <section id="usage">
      <h2>üõ†Ô∏è Installation & Usage</h2>
      <p>To execute a SPELF-compatible file, run the following command using the Floatboat runtime:</p>
      <pre><code>serialkiller-rs-stable serialkiller run secure_program</code></pre>
