            <title>Cyber-tree Visual</title>
            <link>https://gitlab.com/Azccriminalus/cybertree-visual</link>
            <description>
                The main purpose is to determine the attack and necessary scenarios by scanning other cyber attack object structures, providing the basis for the cyber tree structure. With cyber detection, you will no longer be in a situation where you cannot understand or identify any object or creature.

            <description>
                This project is written in C and aims to bring functionalities that are not available in Python as an extension. Some functions may not work correctly, but we will make corrections after releasing the stable version.

            <description>
              This project is based on large language models and a system-level automation framework. It enables users to interact with the system through kernel modules, while the AI layer handles I/O, device, and system components as if it were part of a robotic intelligence structure. Tasks that would normally require manual effort are handled quickly and efficiently by the AI system, allowing for smoother and more autonomous interactions with your Linux environment. Currently, the project supports core components such as I/O management, CPU control, and PCIe (PCIO) operations. If you'd like to contribute to the project, the source code is open.
